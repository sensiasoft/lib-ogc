====================

**THIS REPOSITORY HAS BEEN ARCHIVED AND WILL NOT BE MAINTAINED ANYMORE.**
**The portion of the code that was used by OpenSensorHub has been moved directly under the [OpenSensorHub Core](https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-core) repository**

This open source project aims at building JAVA APIs and implementations of various OGC data models (SensorML, O&M, SWECommon, FES, etc.) and service models (WMS, WFS, WCS, SOS, SPS, etc).
The project was initiated by the VAST Team at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) but is now maintained by Sensia Software and Botts Innovative Research, Inc..
